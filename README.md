I am creating this project as a visual C.V for my web development skills. I am be using HTML and CSS to create a website 
containing 3 pages. A home page, a page of my experiences and a contact page.

 ## UX

 This website has been created to promote my web development skills and work experience to potential employers.
 The site users will be people interested in learning more about me and employers. The website is easy and smooth to use, focused on explaining the important skills and experiences I have. It will also be focused on making it easy if someone will contact me

 * As a user I can see what the main focus of the website is.
 * As a user I can navigate myself to any social media Theo Norris has.
 * As a user I can navigate myself through the additional pages efficiently and effectively.
 * As a user I can view Theo Norris' education and work experiences.
 * As a user I can follow links to look at the schools Theo has studied at and the companies he has worked at.
 * As a user I can contact Theo in regards to offering contracts or employment.
 
## Existing Features

 * A navigation bar allowing users to scroll through the various pages.
 * Social links opening the associated web pages in a new window.
 * Animated sections containing code experiences and school and work links.
 * A contact form for the user to fill out to contact the photographer for projects or any type of interest.

## Testing

Having written my code for each .html page I have validated them on [The W3C Markup validation service](https://validator.w3.org/).
The same applies to my css which I have validated on [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

1. Navbar
* Going through each of the pages, I clicked on each navigation bar link to ensure all pages worked individually.

2. Social Media links
- I went to the social media links on each of the pages and clicked on them to ensure they opened up in new tabs using 'target="_blank"'.

3. Work and school links
- I have been through and checked all the links open in new windows and go to the correct sites.

7. Contact form
- I checked the contact form was responsive and each input required text. I completed this by trying to submit the form without any text. I then repeated the process with each box until the form was filled.

This website was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Microsoft edge.) It is also responsive, having
tested it on chrome developer tools across ipad, various iphones, samsungs etc. I have also tested it on iphone and macbook.
On smaller resolution screens I have extracted some features from the index page. I have taken away two pattern divs on mobile devices.
This is in order to keep the page clean, fresh and minimalistic.

## Deployment

This site is hosted by GitHub pages deployed directly from the master branch. To deploy the website you must first go to your repository on 
GitHub pages. You then click on settings, scroll down to GitHub pages. Select 'master branch' in source, then after a couple of minutes your website
will be deployed. You can then follow the link given in the GitHub pages section (https://theonorris.github.io/miniprojekt1/)

To run locally you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/TheoNorris/miniprojekt1.git` into your terminal.
